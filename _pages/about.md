Mukund Bhandari is a Computational Biologist-II at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. He has 5+ years of research experience in multi-omics, NGS analysis, data science, and machine learning. He is proficient in Python, R, Java, major bioinformatics tools and software. 

As a bioinformatician, he possesses a profound acumen in Cancer Biology, supplemented by proficiency in biostatistics and data science. Through the harmonious amalgamation of his research undertakings, comprehensive training, and scholastic pursuits, Mukund adeptly synthesizes the domains of biology, computer science, and statistics, thereby fortifying his scholarly foundation. 
He utilizes bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, machine learning, and cloud computing to decipher biological information from multi-omics sequencing data, clinical data, and other large public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). He has investigated different cancer types including sarcomas using transcriptomics, epigenomics, genomics and single-cell sequencing data to investigate tumor profiles and molecular targets, explore tumor heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment, and uncover factors driving metastasis and treatment resistance. Additionally, he has indepth understanding of basic and translational research in cancer biology, protein biochemistry, drug discovery, and biotechnology.

Research Work
======
His research endeavors leverage the realms of cancer genomics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning in a concerted effort to unravel the intricacies of biological information derived from clinical samples, sequencing platforms, and publicly accessible data repositories. Employing a diverse repertoire of qualitative, quantitative, and computational methodologies, he meticulously probes the landscape of cancer genomics, with particular emphasis placed on the realm of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). It is worth noting that while his prior contributions predominantly centered around experimental investigations within the domains of cancer biology, neuroscience, protein biochemistry, structural bioinformatics, and drug discovery, he has also embarked upon notable pursuits in the arena of clinical research.
